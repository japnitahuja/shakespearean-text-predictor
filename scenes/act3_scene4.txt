[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]

Capulet. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:2060
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:—Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.2065
Paris. These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
Lady Capulet. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
Capulet. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender2070
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next—2075
But, soft! what day is this?
Paris. Monday, my lord,
Capulet. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.2080
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,—a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:2085
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
Paris. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
Capulet. Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,2090
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.2095
